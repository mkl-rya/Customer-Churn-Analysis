**Customer Churn Analysis and Retention Strategies**
This project leverages SQL-driven analysis to uncover key insights into customer behavior and churn. The objective is to identify factors influencing customer attrition, segment high-risk customers, and propose actionable strategies to enhance retention. By analyzing patterns in purchase frequency, order value, product preferences, and regional trends, this project aims to provide data-driven recommendations for mitigating churn and driving long-term growth.

**Key Objectives**
1 - Customer Purchase Frequency Analysis
Identify customers likely to churn by examining their purchase frequency over time.

2 - Customer Segmentation
Segment customers based on purchase behavior and assess churn risks within each segment.

3-Order Value Comparison
Compare average order values between churning and non-churning customers to identify behavioral patterns.

4 - Order Value Distribution Analysis
Evaluate whether customers placing smaller orders consistently are more likely to churn by analyzing order value distribution.

5 - Product Category Preferences
Identify customers who stop purchasing specific product categories before churning and analyze changes in their preferences.

6 - Category-Level Behavior Analysis
Study the most frequently purchased product categories before and after churn, focusing on customers who shift to different product lines.

7 - Regional Churn Patterns
Analyze churn rates by region to identify geographic trends in purchase behavior and order shipping statuses.

8 - Order Shipping Status Analysis
Investigate patterns in shipping statuses across regions for customers who churn.

9 - Customer Risk Scoring
Develop a scoring mechanism that evaluates customer risk based on purchase frequency, frequency decline, order values, and product category spending.

10 - Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Calculation
Compute CLTV to prioritize retention efforts and optimize resource allocation.
